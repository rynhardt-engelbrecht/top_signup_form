# Sign-up Form

This repository is for the (Project: Sign-Up Form)[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form] lesson from The Odin Project's curriculum.

The goal was to recreate the structure of an image of a sign-up form, with our own creativities.
This is the result of that.
